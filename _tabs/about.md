# Who am I?

Newly in the IT world. I started studying programmation at 42Quebec in march 2022.
I come from a background of management/administration, having worked in the retail and restauration.

# Why this website?

I want to learn more about Jekyll and html as I see a lot of usage in being able to build and
publish websites on my own. In the process, I will try to maintain a bloglike website in order to
provide information and ressources concerning projects and exams related to the 42cursus and future
students.

# Thank you for your time!
